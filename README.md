# Decibel-values-wrt-Windows-volume
A file containing a relationship between decibel values and windows volume level to be used with PyCaw by AndreMiras, to set a specific volume in windows.

I was having problems with definig a function to set an exact volume in windows using the decibel levels, so I have manually found the decibel values which correspond to the actual voulme in windows.
These values are ment to be used with PyCaw by AndreMiras, a powerful python package to control audio sessions and uitlities.
